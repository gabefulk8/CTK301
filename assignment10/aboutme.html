      <p>I'm from Mahomet, IL, a smaller town about 15 minutes from Champaign-Urbana. I graduated highschool there and then studied Computer Science for three years at Carthage College in Kenosha, Wisconsin before transferring into Game Design at Illinois State University. My favorite hobbies include soccer, music, and gaming. I played soccer throughout my youth for recreation and club teams and for our varsity team in highschool. I also love to watch soccer, but mainly just the Premier League where my favorite team, Chelsea FC, plays. When it comes to music, I can't get enough of it. I can play the bass guitar, sing, and I used to play the piano. My most accomplished of those three is singing which was capstoned by my participation in the flagship choir at Carthage which went to Austria and placed first in an international choir competition. Gaming, however, is one of my true passions. I love to play nearly any genre as I can meet and make relationships with tons of awesome like-minded people. My favorite genre to play though, is competitive FPS games. Within that genre, I have devoted the most time to a smaller game called Insurgency:Sandstorm in which I played for a competitive pro-league with much success. I go into more detail for this in my Gaming page.</p>
