      <p>My favorite genre of games to play are first person shooters. My infatuation with the genre started with Battlefield 3 back on my Xbox 360. Once I moved on to the PC, I got really into CS: GO and it grew my passion for   competitive gaming. I started playing at the higher levels of competition when Rainbow Six: Siege first came out, queuing ranked in Diamond with 5-stacks of my friends many of whom played on semi-pro teams. However, I was too young at the time to compete for any of these teams. When Insurgency: Sandstorm, a fast-paced, hardcore, FPS game, came out in 2018, I fell in love with it. I got invested with the community around a competitive 5v5 mode, putting in over 1300 hours in the game. Since 2018, I have won 2 Public Invitational Tournaments, placed 1st in two Regional North American Seasons, and placed in the top 4 for the International World Cup. I also served as an admin for the Community Discord for several months.</p>
